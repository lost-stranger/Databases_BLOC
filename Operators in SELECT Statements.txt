1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT price
FROM products
WHERE name LIKE %Face%;

2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

San Francisco Weekends
E   R         W
L   O         H
E   M         E
C             R
T             E

3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

a. Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%Labrador%' OR breed LIKE '%Labrador' OR breed LIKE 'Labrador%'

b. Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

c. Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE sex = 'female'
AND weight >35;

d. Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%Shepherd' AND breed NOT LIKE '%Shepherd%' AND breed NOT LIKE 'Shepherd%';

e. Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60 OR breed = 'Great Danes';

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

a. SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

Table name : cats

name    | Adoption_date
--------+--------------
Pedro   | 01/08/2013
--------+--------------
Baloo   | 01/07/2016
-----------------------

b. SELECT name, age FROM cats;

Table name : cats

name    | age
--------+-------
Pedro   | 3
--------+-------
Baloo   | 2
----------------

5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

a. Display all the information about all of the available cats.

SELECT *
FROM cats;

b. Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name, sex
FROM cats
WHERE age = 7;

c. Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

SELECT name
FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

> greater than, used when comparing 2 values
< less than, used when comparing 2 values
= equal to, used when comparing 2 values
<= less than or equal to, used when comparing 2 values
>= greater than or equal to, used when comparing 2 values
!= not equal to, used when comparing 2 values
<> greater than or less than, used when comparing 2 values
LIKE Used to pattern match a string, example: "input LIKE 'Bartholemew'"
BETWEEN implemented like "a BETWEEN x AND y"
IS DISTINCT FROM used as "expression IS DISTINCT FROM expression"
IS TRUE / IS FALSE used in the format "expression IS TRUE". Returns either true or false.
IS NULL determines if the contents of a cell are null
AND requires both expressions to be true for the row to be returned
OR Requires one of the expressions to be true for the row to be returned
NOT Requires the expression to be false for the row to be returned

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

a. SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
Table name : Cats

Name   | 
-------|
Pari   | 
-------|
Baby   | 
-------|

SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;

Name   |
-------|
Pari   | 
-------|
Baby   | 
-------|

SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;

Id   |
-----|
157  | 
-----|
158  |
