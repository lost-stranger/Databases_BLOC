1. How do you find related data held in two separate data tables?

>One can use JOIN statements to find related data in two separate data tables.

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between an INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Give a real-world example for each.

> INNER JOIN: Combines two tables showing the rows that has commmon data elements in both rows as joined data sets
  LEFT OUTER JOIN: Combines two tables showing all the rows of the left data set, along with the ones that has commmon data elements in both rows as joined data sets
  RIGTH OUTER JOIN: Combines two tables showing all the rows of the right data set, along with the ones that has commmon data elements in both rows as joined data sets

3. Define primary key and foreign key. Give a real-world example for each.

> Primary key: it is a column in a table that has data that uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
  Foreign Key: It is one or more columns on one table that refers to the primmary key in another table.

Table name : Country_Temps

Country | Temp
--------+--------------
India   | 32 C
--------+--------------
US      | 25 C
-----------------------

Table name : Country_Season

Count_name| Adoption_date
----------+--------------
US        | Fall
----------+--------------
India     | Monsoon
-----------------------

When joining the above two tables, 'Country' is the Primary Key for 'Country_Temps', while 'Count-name' acts as the Foreign Key that the primary key refers to.

4. Define aliasing.
