Questions

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

> Adding: INSERTS INTO
  Updating: UPDATE
  Deleting: DELETE

2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

a. CREATE TABLE:
CREATE TABLE products (
      id integer,
      name text,
      price numeric(5, 2)
  );

Structure: CREATE TABLE-creates a table with column names with data type and format to be entered in each columen

b. INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
  VALUES
  (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99);

Structure: Inserts into the table a row of data that meets the data type and format as decided in CREATE TABLE command

c. UPDATE products SET price=159.99 WHERE id=11773;

Structure: Updates a value in a column of a row where the a value in one of the columns of the row matches the Where value

d. DELETE FROM products WHERE id=11776;

Structure: Deletes a full row where the a value in one of the columns of the row matches the Where value

e. ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN description text SET DEFAULT 'None';

Structure: Alters the table schema by adding a new column with name description and sets default value as None

f. DROP TABLE products;

Stucture: Deletes the entire table

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

 - Boolean:  True <used when the values need to be True or False - e.g. Payment made -true or false>
 - smallint: whole numbers upt to a small range  - e.g. 32767 <used for smaller numbers - # of soccer player in a team>
 - bigint: whole numbers, large range - e.g. 9223372036854775807 <used for larger numbers - population of thw world>
 - numeric: up to 131072 digits before the decimal point; up to 16383 digits after the decimal point. - e.g. 23.34 <used for currency type values>
 - text: variable of unlimited length - e.g. 'developer' <any field that takes a string type value - e.g. names>

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

a. Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
First and last name - Text
Whether they sent in their RSVP - Boolean
Number of guests - numeric (3)
Number of meals - numeric (3,1)

b. Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

CREATE TABLE wedding-dinner (
 name text,
 RSVP boolean,
 guestsNumber numeric (3),
 mealsNumber numeric (3,1));

c. Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.

ALTER TABLE wedding-dinner ADD COLUMN thank-you-card boolean SET DEFAULT false;
//when a thank you card receive, we can update the false for true for that row//

d. You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.

ALTER TABLE wedding-dinner DROP COLUMN mealsNumber;

e. The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.

ALTER TABLE wedding-dinner ADD COLUMN tableNumber numeric (3);

f. The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.

DROP TABLE weddding-dinner;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

CREATE TABLE library (
 ISBN varchar,
 title text,
 author text,
 genre text,
 publishingDate date,
 numCopies integer,
 availableCopies integer;)

a. Find three books and add their information to the table.

INSERT INTO library VALUES 
('000001', 'Oliver Twist, 'Charles Dickens', 'Classic', '1923-02-12', 50, 3),
('000002', 'Pet Semetry, 'Stephen King', 'Horror', '1965-03-12', 25, 17),
('000003', 'Management', 'Peter Drucker', 'Nonfiction-Business', '1985-03-12', 7, 0);

c. Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.

UPDATE library SET availableCopies = availableCopies - 1 WHERE ISBN = 000002;

d. Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN = 000003; 

6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
id numeric (6), 
name text, 
yrLaunched date, 
countryOrigin text, 
missionDesc text, 
orbitingBody text, 
isOperational boolean, 
distEarthMiles integer);

a. Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.

INSERT INTO spacecrafts VALUES 
(000001, 'Journeyer 1', '02/12/1990', 'Canada', 'Visit nearest star', 'Alpha Centauri', True, 469797),
(000002, 'Journeyer 2', '12/08/1985', 'Canada', 'Travel through a worm-hole', 'Krypton', False, 6587879),
(000003, 'Journeyer 3', '07/02/2014', 'Canada', 'Find an earth like planet', 'Sombrero Galaxy', True, 988798798);


b. Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.

DEELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id = 000002;

c. Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

UPDATE spacecrafts SET isOperational = False WHERE id = 000003;

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE inbox (
id integer, 
subLine text, 
sender text, 
addlRecipients text, 
emailBody text, 
timeStamp timestamp, 
emailRead boolean, 
emailChainId integer);

a. Add three new emails to the inbox.

INSERT INTO inbox VALUES
(001, 'Meeting tomorrow', 'Jane Ripter', 'Fred Forsythe', 'Meet tomorrow at 2PM?', TIMESTAMP '2016-06-22 19:10:25', True, 001),
(002, 'Notes', 'John Roary', 'Frank Flem', 'Supply is limited by investment category', TIMESTAMP '2017-11-21 19:10:25', True, 002),
(003, 'No poles', 'Jerry Rags', 'Flossy Flagana', 'Oceans pour over the edges', TIMESTAMP '2018-08-02 19:10:25', True, 003);

b. You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

DELETE FROM inbox WHERE id = 001;

c. You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.

UPDATE inbox SET emailRead = False WHERE id = 002;
